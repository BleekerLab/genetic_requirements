# Genetic requirements of 7-epizingiberene production in S. habrochaites

Codes and data for the figures of the "genetic requirement" paper.

# Figure List 

## Fig 1. Phenotyping the F1's  
* A) Metabolite levels of F1 + F1-hab + parents in leaf-wash
* B) Trichome density  F1 + F1-hab + parents

## Fig 2: distribution volatiles F2  

## Fig 3: trichome density relationship to volatile production     
* (A) Trichome-density classes F2 VS zingiberene content.   
* (B) Scatterplot volatiles per type/VI gland VS trichome density.

## Fig 4: active and lazy class  
* (A) Shapes of 'Active' & 'lazy' storage compartments.  
* (B) Quantification of storage cavities.   
* (C) Fosmidomycin on PI127826 = collapse of storage-cavity.     

## Fig 5: inhibition of MEP and MVA pathwas
