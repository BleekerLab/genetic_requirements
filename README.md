## Figure List Thesis Ruy

Fig 1. Phenotyping the F1's
* A) Metabolite levels of F1 + F1-hab + parents in leaf-wash
* B) Trichome density  F1 + F1-hab + parents
* C) zFPS/FPS ZIS/PHS1 expression (?? This will also come forward later in the RNA-seq) 
* D) Whitefly clipcage assay F1 + F1-hab + parents

Fig 2: Volatiles full F2 + Trichome density classes 

Fig 3: "Selected" F2 lines: Type-VI trichome density + Metabolite levels per trichome + whitefly phenotype

Fig 4: Selection on "Active" and "Lazy" F2 lines: metabolite levels per trichome + cavilty volume

Fig 5: Fosmidomycin / Mevastatin treatment of "Active" / "Lazy" F2 lines + paren

Fig 6: RNA seq of F1 + F2s. Heatmap of differentially expressed genes active vs. lazy + MapMan figure of MEP/MEV pathway (?)

Fig.7: PLS-DA of RNA-seq data (?)

Fig 8: Allele-specific expressed genes

Fig S1: Trichome morphology of F1 (not the cavity, but the "square shape" of the trichomes, as published recently) 

Fig S2: Zingiberene-and derivatives levels in a BC population

Fig S3: Plasidial terpenes vs. cytosolic terpene levels in full F2
