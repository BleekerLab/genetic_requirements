# Figures

- __Figure 1:__ Terpene levels and type-VI trichome density of CVxPI127826 F1 cross.
    * (A) Metabolite levels of F1 + F1-hab + parents in leaf-wash.
    * (B) Trichome density of F1, F1-_hab_ and their parents.
- __Figure 2:__ Distribution of 7-epizingiberene levels in the F2 population.
- __Figure 3:__ Trichome density vs 7-epizingiberene levels.
	* (A) Trichome-density classes F2 VS zingiberene content.   
	* (B) Scatterplot volatiles per type/VI gland VS trichome density.
- __Figure 4:__ Storage-cavity volume of active and lazy genotypes.
	* (A) Shapes of 'Active' & 'lazy' storage compartments.  
	* (B) Quantification of storage cavities.   
	* (C) Fosmidomycin on PI127826 = collapse of storage-cavity.    
- __Figure 5:__ Storage-cavity volume depends on activity of the gland cells.
	* Fosmidomycin and Mevastatin treatment of "Active" / "Lazy" F2 lines + parent (precursor flux is difference between wild and cultivated tomato with more transfer from plastid to cytosol in PI127826).
