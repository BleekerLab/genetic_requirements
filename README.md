Codes and data for the figures of the "genetic requirement" paper

## Figure List Thesis Ruy 

Fig 1. Phenotyping the F1's
* A) Metabolite levels of F1 + F1-hab + parents in leaf-wash
* B) Trichome density  F1 + F1-hab + parents
* C) Whitefly clipcage assay F1 + F1-hab + parents

Fig 2: (A) Distribution volatiles F2
       (B) Volatiles classes vs 7-epizingiberene

Fig 3: (A) "Selected" F2 lines: Type-VI trichome density VS Metabolite levels per leaf (density adds but does not explain the full phenotype)
       (B) Distribution head-cells of selected F2

Fig 4: (A) Shapes of 'Active' & 'lazy'
       (B) Selection on 3x"Active" and 3x"Lazy" F2 lines: metabolite levels per head-cell + cavity volume (large cavity size is related to high metabolite levels)

fig extra: relation ZGB quantity (i.e. cavity volume) vs whitefly survival. (predictor for resistance)

Fig 5: Fosmidomycin / Mevastatin treatment of "Active" / "Lazy" F2 lines + parent (precursor flux is difference between wild and cultivated tomato with more transfer from plastid to cytosol in PI127826)

Fig 6: RNA seq of F1 + F2s. Heatmap of differentially expressed genes active vs. lazy + MapMan figure of MEP/MEV pathway (?) (check comparing only F2 active to F2 lazy). 

Fig.7: PLS-DA of RNA-seq data (?)

Fig 8: Allele-specific expressed genes

Fig S1: All terpenes in F1 (+parents)

Fig S2: Other classes of trichomes in F1

Fig S3: Barplot of 7-epizingiberene in the Full F2

Fig S4: Barplot terpene content per type-VI head cell selected F2s

Fig S5: Acylsugar measurements full F2 (done with rhodamine stainig in plate-reader) + Acylsugar levels VS. Type I/IV trichome classes

Fig S5: Cavity volume vs. whitefly mortality (needs to be in main-text (somewhere))

Fig S6: Acylsugar profiles "Active" and "Lazy" F2 lines

Fig S7: Heatmap / Table of MVA / MEP pathway genes + ABC-transporters + LTPs + Transcription Factors
